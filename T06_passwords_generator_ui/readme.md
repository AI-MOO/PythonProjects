# Python Application: Random Password Generator with user interface using PyQt5 library
**1- Install PyQt5 Library by cmd**

`pip install PyQt5`

**2- I designed the front end part (password_generator.ui) by Qt Designer software, if you want to make any modifications, you can download the software through the link below**

[Qt Designer software (Link)](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download)

**3- if you made any modification, save your work on the Desktop and you will have a .ui file, to convert it to python file (.py), open cmd and navigate the directory of the file and type thef following commands**

`cd Desktop`

`pyuic5 -x password_generator -o password_generator.py`

**Note: the converted python file will be saved on the Desktop as (password_generator.py)**

**4- Run the python file and specify your password limit as shown below**
